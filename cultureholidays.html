                <h1>Language</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 40px;">In Hong Kong, the national language is recognized as Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin ) and English. Cantonese is spoken by about 88% of the population while English is only spoken by around 5% of the population and Mandarin by about 2.6% of the population. While Cantonese  and Mandarin are both considered Chinese, they both hold many differences as Cantonese has 6 tones compared to Mandarin with 4 tones. The writing system in both languages are the same, but Hong Kong does rely on Traditional Chinese writing while Mainland China uses the simplified Chinese characters.
